# Email System Migration: Mailjet to Resend

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of our email delivery system from Mailjet to Resend. The migration was completed on the `feature/resend-migration` branch and includes the implementation of React Email templates, a new email service module, and unsubscribe functionality.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dependencies Added

- `resend`: Modern email API with React support
- `@react-email/components`: React components for email templates

### 2. New Files Created

- `src/services/resend.ts`: Email service module for sending emails with Resend
- `src/emails/WelcomeEmail.tsx`: React Email template for welcome emails
- `src/emails/OrderConfirmationEmail.tsx`: React Email template for order confirmations
- `functions/unsubscribe.js`: Netlify function for handling unsubscribe requests

### 3. Files Modified

- `functions/welcome-email.js`: Updated to use Resend instead of Mailjet
- `.env.example`: Added Resend API key and email configuration
- `README.md`: Updated project status to reflect completed email migration
- `TODO-EMAIL_MIGRATION.md`: Updated to mark completed tasks

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Modern Developer Experience**: React-based email templates are easier to maintain and update
2. **Improved Email Design**: Consistent styling across all email templates
3. **Better Deliverability**: Resend has excellent deliverability rates
4. **Cost Savings**: Resend offers a generous free tier (3,000 emails/month)
5. **Simplified API**: Cleaner, more intuitive API compared to Mailjet
6. **Future-Proof**: Better compatibility with future Astro migration

## Required Environment Variables

```
# Resend API Key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_123456789

# Email Configuration
FROM_EMAIL=hello@omnis-lb.com
```

## Testing the Migration

1. **Subscribe to Newsletter**: Test the subscription flow by entering an email on the homepage
2. **Check Welcome Email**: Verify that the welcome email is received and displays correctly
3. **Test Unsubscribe**: Click the unsubscribe link in the welcome email to test the unsubscribe flow
4. **Place Test Order**: Place a test order to verify the order confirmation email

## Next Steps

1. **Email Analytics**: Implement open and click tracking
2. **Email Testing**: Test email delivery across different email clients
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy the migration to production

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues with Resend, we can roll back to Mailjet by:

1. Reverting the changes in `functions/welcome-email.js`
2. Removing the Resend dependencies
3. Ensuring the Mailjet API keys are still available in the environment variables

## Conclusion

The migration from Mailjet to Resend has been successfully completed, providing a more modern and developer-friendly email system. The new system is ready for testing and deployment to production.
